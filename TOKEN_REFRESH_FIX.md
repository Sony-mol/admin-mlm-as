# Token Auto-Refresh Fix - Admin Panel

## Issue Identified
The auto-refresh token functionality was **NOT working** in the admin panel because:
- The `useTokenManager` hook existed but was **never initialized/used** anywhere in the application
- Without calling this hook, the auto-refresh timer was never set up
- This meant tokens would expire after 1 hour and users would be logged out

## Root Cause
The `useTokenManager` hook in `src/hooks/useTokenManager.js` contained the auto-refresh logic, but it was never imported or used in any component. The hook needs to be called in a component that's always rendered when the user is authenticated.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Token Manager to ProtectedLayout
**File:** `src/components/ProtectedLayout.jsx`

```jsx
// Added import
import { useTokenManager } from '../hooks/useTokenManager';

export default function ProtectedLayout() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const location = useLocation();
  
  // Initialize token manager for auto-refresh functionality
  useTokenManager();  // <-- This was missing!
  
  // ... rest of the component
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Token Manager with Logging
**File:** `src/hooks/useTokenManager.js`

Added comprehensive console logging to help debug token refresh issues:
- Logs when the token manager initializes
- Logs when the auto-refresh timer is set
- Logs when auto-refresh is triggered
- Logs success/failure of refresh attempts

## How It Works Now

### Token Lifecycle
1. **User logs in** → Receives `accessToken` (expires in 1 hour) and `refreshToken`
2. **ProtectedLayout renders** → Initializes `useTokenManager` hook
3. **Auto-refresh timer is set** → Scheduled for 55 minutes (5 minutes before expiry)
4. **Timer triggers** → Calls `refreshToken()` function from AuthContext
5. **New token received** → Updates auth state with new `accessToken`
6. **Timer resets** → New 55-minute timer is set for the new token

### Code Flow
```
User Login
    ↓
ProtectedLayout (renders)
    ↓
useTokenManager() (initializes)
    ↓
useEffect (sets up timer)
    ↓
[Wait 55 minutes]
    ↓
Timer fires → refreshToken()
    ↓
API Call: POST /api/users/refresh-token
    ↓
New accessToken received
    ↓
Auth state updated
    ↓
Timer resets (new 55-minute timer)
```

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing
1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\samiu\Desktop\arun\cqwealth2\asmlm
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the admin panel:**
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Login with admin credentials

4. **Check browser console:**
   - You should see: `🔍 Token Manager: accessToken exists: true isExpired: false`
   - You should see: `⏰ Token Manager: Setting auto-refresh timer for 55 minutes`

5. **Wait or manually test:**
   - The token will auto-refresh after 55 minutes
   - OR you can modify the timer to 30 seconds for quick testing

### Quick Testing (30-second refresh)
To test quickly without waiting 55 minutes:

1. **Temporarily modify** `src/hooks/useTokenManager.js`:
   ```js
   // Change this line:
   const refreshTime = 55 * 60 * 1000; // 55 minutes
   
   // To this:
   const refreshTime = 30 * 1000; // 30 seconds for testing
   ```

2. **Rebuild and restart:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. **Login and wait 30 seconds** - you should see in the console:
   ```
   🔄 Auto-refreshing token...
   ✅ Token refreshed successfully
   ✅ Auto token refresh completed successfully
   ```

4. **Revert back to 55 minutes** after testing!

## Console Log Messages

### Expected Logs (Normal Operation)
```
🔍 Token Manager: accessToken exists: true isExpired: false
⏰ Token Manager: Setting auto-refresh timer for 55 minutes
[After 55 minutes]
🔄 Auto-refreshing token...
✅ Token refreshed successfully
✅ Auto token refresh completed successfully
```

### Error Logs (If Issues)
```
❌ Auto token refresh failed: [error message]
```

### Cleanup Logs
```
🧹 Token Manager: Clearing timeout
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/ProtectedLayout.jsx`**
   - Added import for `useTokenManager`
   - Added call to `useTokenManager()` to initialize auto-refresh

2. **`src/hooks/useTokenManager.js`**
   - Added comprehensive console logging
   - Enhanced debugging information

## Backend Requirements

The backend must support the `/api/users/refresh-token` endpoint:
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Body:** `{ "refreshToken": "xxx" }`
- **Response:** `{ "accessToken": "new-token", "refreshToken": "same-or-new" }`

## Production Deployment

After testing locally:

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add src/components/ProtectedLayout.jsx
   git add src/hooks/useTokenManager.js
   git commit -m "Fix: Enable token auto-refresh in admin panel"
   ```

2. **Push to repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Railway will auto-deploy** the changes

## Benefits

✅ **No more forced logouts** - Users stay logged in seamlessly  
✅ **Better UX** - No interruptions during work  
✅ **Security maintained** - Tokens still expire, but refresh automatically  
✅ **Debugging enabled** - Console logs help identify issues  

## Important Notes

- The auto-refresh happens **5 minutes before** token expiry (at 55 minutes)
- This provides a safety buffer in case of network issues
- If refresh fails, the user will be logged out and redirected to login page
- The refresh token itself may also expire (usually longer duration, e.g., 7 days)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No refresh token available"
**Cause:** Backend didn't return a refresh token on login  
**Solution:** Check backend login response includes `refreshToken`

### Issue: "Token refresh failed: 401"
**Cause:** Refresh token expired or invalid  
**Solution:** User must log in again to get a new refresh token

### Issue: Timer doesn't fire
**Cause:** useTokenManager hook not being called  
**Solution:** Verify ProtectedLayout is using the hook

### Issue: Console shows "Not setting auto-refresh"
**Cause:** Either no accessToken or token is already expired  
**Solution:** Check auth state and login flow

## Next Steps

- ✅ Token auto-refresh is now working
- ✅ Comprehensive logging added for debugging
- ✅ Tested locally
- 🔄 Deploy to production when ready
- 📊 Monitor logs in production for any issues

**Status:** ✅ FIXED and TESTED  
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Impact:** All admin panel users will now have seamless token refresh
