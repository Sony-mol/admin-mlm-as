# Quick Verification Guide - Token Auto-Refresh

## ✅ The Fix is Complete!

The token auto-refresh was **NOT working** because the `useTokenManager` hook was never initialized. This has been fixed!

## What Was Fixed?

1. **Added `useTokenManager` to ProtectedLayout** - The hook is now called when users are authenticated
2. **Enhanced logging** - Console shows when token refresh is working

## How to Verify Locally (Right Now!)

### Step 1: Access the Admin Panel
The server is already running at: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 2: Login
Use your admin credentials to login

### Step 3: Open Browser Console
Press `F12` or right-click → "Inspect" → "Console" tab

### Step 4: Look for These Messages
You should immediately see:
```
🔍 Token Manager: accessToken exists: true isExpired: false
⏰ Token Manager: Setting auto-refresh timer for 55 minutes
```

### Step 5: Verify It's Working
If you see those messages, **token auto-refresh is working!** ✅

## Quick Test (30 seconds instead of 55 minutes)

Want to see it refresh right now? Follow these steps:

1. **Edit the file:**
   - Open: `src/hooks/useTokenManager.js`
   - Find line 19: `const refreshTime = 55 * 60 * 1000;`
   - Change to: `const refreshTime = 30 * 1000;`

2. **Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Restart the server:**
   - Stop current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
   - Run: `npm start`

4. **Login again** and watch the console

5. **After 30 seconds**, you'll see:
   ```
   🔄 Auto-refreshing token...
   🔄 Refreshing access token...
   ✅ Token refreshed successfully
   ✅ Auto token refresh completed successfully
   ⏰ Token Manager: Setting auto-refresh timer for 55 minutes
   ```

6. **IMPORTANT: Revert the change!**
   - Change back to: `const refreshTime = 55 * 60 * 1000;`
   - Rebuild again: `npm run build`

## What Happens in Production?

- Token auto-refreshes every **55 minutes** (5 minutes before expiry)
- Users stay logged in seamlessly
- No more forced logouts
- Better user experience

## Files Changed

- ✅ `src/components/ProtectedLayout.jsx` - Added useTokenManager initialization
- ✅ `src/hooks/useTokenManager.js` - Enhanced with logging

## Console Messages Reference

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 🔍 Token Manager: accessToken exists: true | Token manager detected valid token |
| ⏰ Setting auto-refresh timer for 55 minutes | Auto-refresh scheduled |
| 🔄 Auto-refreshing token... | Token refresh started |
| ✅ Token refreshed successfully | New token received |
| ❌ Auto token refresh failed | Refresh failed (user will be logged out) |
| 🧹 Clearing timeout | Cleanup on component unmount |

## Troubleshooting

### Don't see the messages?
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check that the build completed successfully
- Clear browser cache and reload

### See "Not setting auto-refresh"?
- This means token is already expired
- Logout and login again

### See refresh failed?
- Check backend is running
- Check `/api/users/refresh-token` endpoint is working
- Verify backend returns `refreshToken` on login
