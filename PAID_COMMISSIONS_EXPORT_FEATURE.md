3. File is automatically downloaded with a timestamped filename
4. Success notification confirms the export

### Managing Selection
- **Clear Selection**: Deselect all selected commissions
- **Select All**: Select all currently filtered commissions (respects search filters)
- Selection persists across the current session

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
const [selectedPaidCommissions, setSelectedPaidCommissions] = useState(new Set());
```
Uses a Set for efficient lookup and management of selected commission IDs.

### Key Functions

#### `togglePaidCommission(commissionId)`
Toggles the selection state of a single commission.

#### `selectAllPaidCommissions()`
Selects all commissions in the current filtered view.

#### `clearPaidSelection()`
Clears all selections.

#### `exportSelectedPaidCommissions()`
Exports selected commissions to Excel format with proper formatting.

### Data Export
- Uses the existing `ExportService` for consistent export functionality
- Formats dates to Indian Standard Time (IST)
- Includes user names resolved from the `userNames` mapping
- Handles missing data gracefully with fallback values

## Search Integration
- Selection works seamlessly with the search functionality
- "Select All" respects the current search filter
- Filtering doesn't clear existing selections

## Benefits

1. **Selective Reporting**: Export only relevant commissions for specific reports
2. **Data Privacy**: Share only necessary commission data with stakeholders
3. **Performance**: Export smaller datasets for faster processing
4. **Flexibility**: Choose exactly what data to export
5. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive checkbox interface familiar to all users
